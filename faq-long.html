				<h3>
					<i></i>
					<span class="title-name">Can I add my own link?</span>
				</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="toggle-inner">
				<p>Yes! All you need to do is click the button 'Add your link' and go through the process. Once you're done and paid initial fee defined by publisher you need to wait until your link's accepted to be visible.</p>
			</div>

				<h3>
				<i></i>
				<span class="title-name">My link's still not visible in the widget. What's happening?</span>
				</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="toggle-inner">
				<p>Nothing to worry about! There might be few reasons:</p>
				<p>
					<br>a) Your transaction is still pending. Please check the status and see if your link is already visible to the publisher.
					<br>b) Publisher still did not accept your request, it would be best to contact him.

				<h3>
					<i></i>
					<span class="title-name">Publisher did not accept my request. Can I get a refund?</span>
				</h3>
			</div>
				
			<div class="toggle-inner">
				<p>Unfortunately, no. Publisher defines initial fee as a form of handshake, usually it's clearly defined what types of links are expected in a widget as well.</p>

					<span class="title-name">My link is accepted, however I can't see it on the website!</span>
				</h3>
			</div>
				
			<div class="toggle-inner">
				<p>It's probably because your link is not boosted and it's outside of the slots. Just add some tokens to it and watch it grow! :)</p>
